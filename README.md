## What are tickets and can I respond to them?
~~~~
What are tickets?
Members of the server can create tickets, and every role above @Trial Helper can respond to them.
Support Tickets - General Server Support
Report Tickets - Reporting another member for innapropriate behaviour or for another reason
Giveaway Tickets - The member that created the ticket probably won a giveaway, whoever hosted the giveaway, can respond to the ticket (if they are staff), although, if the person that hosted the giveaway is offline, you are more than welcome to tell them that they're gonna get their reward later.

Remember, only ONE staff member can respond to a ticket.

## Here are the basic rules (taken from #rules)
~~~~
1. Be Respectful
You must respect all users, regardless of your liking towards them. Treat others the way you want to be treated.

2. No Inappropriate Language
The use of profanity should be kept to a minimum. However, any derogatory language towards any user is prohibited.

3. No spamming
Don't send a lot of small messages right after each other. Do not disrupt chat by spamming.

4. No adult/gory material
This is a community server and not meant to share this kind of material.

5. No advertisements
We do not tolerate any kind of advertisements, whether it be for other communities or streams. You can message an administrator fan-art to send it in the #ðŸŽ¨ãƒ»fanart channel if it is relevant and provides actual value (Art)

6. No offensive names and profile pictures
You will be asked to change your name or picture if the staff deems them inappropriate.

7. Server Raiding
Raiding or mentions of raiding are not allowed.

8. Direct & Indirect Threats
Threats to other users of DDoS, Death, DoX, abuse, and other malicious threats are absolutely prohibited and disallowed.

9. Follow the Discord TOS
You can find them here: https://discordapp.com/guidelines

10. Do not join voice chat channels without permission of the people already in there
If you see that they have a free spot it is alright to join and ask whether they have an open spot, but leave if your presence is not wanted by whoever was there first.

11. Do not mention ranks and/or members for no reason
Don't just ping @Zeez , or anyone for that matter for no reason, it's not cool.

12. Use channels for its purpose.
Ex. Use channels like ðŸ¤–ãƒ»bot-commands for bot commands, and not for chatting.

13. Do not harass members.
Do not make fun of people. This could be for who they are, what they do, etc.
The Admins and Mods will Mute/Kick/Ban per discretion. If you feel mistreated dm an Admin and we will resolve the issue.

First, you could ask them to stop, if they do, you can move on.
If they don't stop, you can warn them, 3 warnings should be a kick, while 5 should be a temporary or permanent ban.
