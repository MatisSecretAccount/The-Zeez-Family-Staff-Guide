## What are tickets and can I respond to them?
~~~~
What are tickets?
Members of the server can create tickets, and every role above @Trial Helper can respond to them.
Support Tickets - General Server Support
Report Tickets - Reporting another member for innapropriate behaviour or for another reason
Giveaway Tickets - The member that created the ticket probably won a giveaway, whoever hosted the giveaway, can respond to the ticket (if they are staff), although, if the person that hosted the giveaway is offline, you are more than welcome to tell them that they're gonna get their reward later.

Remember, only ONE staff member can respond to a ticket.
